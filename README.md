# COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Our Course Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate online learning. Built with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, it provides a seamless experience for students, instructors, and administrators.


User Roles: Supports students, instructors, and admins with role-based access.

Course Management: Instructors can create, update, and delete courses.

Course Enrollment: Students can browse and enroll in courses.
Admin Control: Admins have full control over users and courses.

API-Driven: The backend exposes RESTful APIs (/cms/api/courses, /cms/api/login, etc.).

## How To Run
1. For Backend

  Run it as a SpringBoot Application

2. For Frontend
```bash
  npm run dev
```
